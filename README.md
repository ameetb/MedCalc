# MedCalc
A simple app for doctors to calculate the dosage of different medications they should prescribe for a patient. 
After entering basic information about a certain patient, users can select which medicines to add by using a auto-complete text search box.
Added medicines will be displayed in a list below with the suggested dosage calculated from the patient's information.

The app currently has a few example "medicines" stored in the text file where real medicines and dosages will be added once a reliable source
has been located to provide this information.
